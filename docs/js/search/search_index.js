This is a toy project for a headless TMS built with \n    NestJS and MongoDB, enabling teams to \n    create, manage, and close tickets, \n    track their status and prioritize tasks.\n  \n  \n   \n  \n\n\n🚀 Getting Started\nTo get started with this project, you can choose to either run the project natively on your machine, or with Docker.\n🏠 Running natively\nTo run the project natively, you will need to have Node.js v22.12.0 or higher and npm v10.9.0 or higher installed on your machine.\n\n🍴 Clone this repository to your local machine.\n💻 Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.\n🚀 Start a MongoDB instance on your machine by following the instructions provided by MongoDB for your specific operating system. You can download the MongoDB Community Server from here.\n📝 Rename .env.example to .env and replace the values with your own MongoDB connection details and desired api port.\n🚀 Run npm start to start the server.\n\n🐳 Running with Docker\nTo run the project with Docker, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.\n\n🍴 Clone this repository to your local machine.\n📝 Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Open the .env file and specify the desired values for MONGODB_URI and PORT variables.\nFor example:Example :# The MongoDB connection string for the TMS database\nMONGODB_URI=\"mongodb://mongodb/test\"\n# The port on which the TMS API will run\nPORT=\"3000\"\n# The seed string to be used for the JwtStrategy\nJWT_SECRET=\"42\"\n🐳 Run docker compose build to build the containers.\n🐳 Run docker compose up to start the containers.\n🌍 The API will be available at http://localhost:3000/.\n\n📖 Usage\nOnce the server is running, you can use the following endpoints to manage your projects/tickets:\nAuthenticate\n\nPOST /api/v1/register: Gives the ability to register\nPOST /api/v1/login: Returns a jwt token for authentication\n\nProjects\n\nGET /api/v1/projects: Returns a list of all projects\nPOST /api/v1/projects: Create a new project\nGET /api/v1/projects/:id: Returns a specific project by project ID.\nPATCH /api/v1/projects/:id: Update a project by ID\nDELETE /api/v1/projects/:id: Delete a project by ID\n\nTickets\n\nGET /api/v1/tickets: Returns a list of all tickets\nPOST /api/v1/tickets: Create a new ticket\nGET /api/v1/tickets/:id: Returns a specific ticket by ticket ID.\nPATCH /api/v1/tickets/:id: Update an existing ticket by ID\nDELETE /api/v1/tickets:id: Delete a ticket by ID\n\nHealth\n\nGET /heath: Returns useful system information, such as server uptime and memory usage. This endpoint can be used to monitor the health of the application.\n\n🚀 Future Improvements\nHere are some potential improvements that could be made to this project:\n\n Write Jest tests\n Add a process manager\n Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse\n Introduce automated ticket workflows or rules\n Create a frontend interface for ticket management.\n Add support for more auth providers (Auth0, OAuth2, etc)\n Implement backup and restore mechanism for data recovery\n Implement real-time ticket updates using WebSockets or SSE\n Add search and filter functionality for tickets and projects\n Enable file attachments for tickets (e.g., screenshots, logs)\n Improve documentation with detailed user guides and API examples\n Implement audit logs to track changes made to tickets and projects\n Optimize system performance (database queries, caching, file uploads)\n Support multiple languages for localization/internationalization (i18n)\n Add Github Actions to publish image to Docker Hub, Github Registry, etc.\n Allow customization of ticket fields (priority, labels, custom statuses)\n Support multiple deployment environments (e.g., dev, staging, production)\n Enable user profile changes and preferences (e.g., email notifications, themes)\n Create a reporting feature for ticket data (e.g., total tickets, resolution time)\n Add User Roles and Permissions for different access levels (admin, manager, developer)\n\n🤝 Contributing\nContributions to this project are welcome!
